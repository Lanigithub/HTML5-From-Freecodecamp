**** HTML Documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

************
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

Introduction to HTML5 Elements:
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.
***************
--Paragraph and line break:
<p></p> A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
<hr></hr> : The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
<br></br> : The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph
